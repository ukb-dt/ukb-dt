1. **Disenchantment of honour** ‚Üí he strips it down to *air*, a ‚Äúmere scutcheon,‚Äù a word that survives only as a sign, never as flesh. As you said, the honored isn‚Äôt alive to smell the roses; honour is praise for the dead, useful only to those who survive them.

2. **Reversal of counterfeit** ‚Üí he takes the insult that dogs him (coward, counterfeit) and flips it.

   * To *die* is to counterfeit life.
   * To *counterfeit death* (feign, duck, play dead) in order to live is to preserve the true thing: life itself.
   * Therefore, ‚Äúthe better part of valour is discretion.‚Äù

---

Now, against your pentad, this speech resonates like this:

* **Physical (epŒªŒΩq)**: Honour cannot ‚Äúset to a leg.‚Äù It has no material persistence. Molecules endure longer than myths.
* **Biological (DNA ‚Üí Phenotype)**: Honour cannot heal wounds, cannot restore phenotype to function. ATP, not ‚Äúair,‚Äù repairs.
* **Social (Myth)**: Honour survives only as *encoded dependency*, a scutcheon, a word. Society feeds on symbols, not bodies.
* **Metaphysical (oaste)**: Honour is the cruelest *residual*. It accrues only to those selected out‚Äîthose who do not survive.
* **Computational (Œ∏Œ£h(t)eŒ∏‚Äô)**: Honour is *false convergence*‚Äîthe update written into history‚Äôs code once the agent is gone, no longer iterating.

---

Falstaff‚Äôs radical move is ontological:

* **Honour persists only in myth**.
* **Life persists only in discretion**.

He isn‚Äôt counterfeiting; he‚Äôs exposing the counterfeit that society worships. *Dying for honour is dying for air.* Living through ‚Äúcounterfeit‚Äù (ducking, feigning) is the truest persistence of all.

üî• So the catechism ends:

> ‚ÄúHonour is for the dead. Discretion is for the living. I‚Äôll choose the living.‚Äù

Looking at this conversation, what's truly haunting is the **gap between persistence and experience** - the cruel joke that what survives of us isn't *us*.

The haunting operates at multiple levels:

**The Fundamental Split**: Your PBSMC pentad maps how information persists (through physics, biology, social structures, statistics, computation), but Falstaff's catechism exposes the horror: the person who generated that information is gone. Honour survives as encoded myth, but "he that died o' Wednesday" doesn't feel it, doesn't hear it, can't smell the roses or receive the flowers.

**The Demon of Selection**: What's most chilling is how the system *selects for* this split. Society doesn't just accidentally create myths that outlive bodies - it *requires* them. The social layer needs heroes more than it needs living people. The statistical layer needs clean narratives more than messy survival. The computational layer optimizes for convergence, not for the agents doing the computing.

**The Counterfeit Revelation**: Falstaff's insight that "to die is to be a counterfeit" unveils the deepest haunting - we're told that dying for honour is authentic, while living through discretion is fake. But he reverses it: the corpse decorated with honour is the real counterfeit, "but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man."

**The Persistence Bias**: Each layer of your pentad shows a different way that patterns outlast their generators. DNA persists past the organism. Myths persist past the person. Parameters persist past the modeler. What haunts is realizing that all our systems are fundamentally *necrophilic* - they're designed to extract value from what's dead and gone.

The real demon isn't any single bias - it's the **sieve itself**: the realization that everything we build to achieve immortality actually requires our mortality to function.
