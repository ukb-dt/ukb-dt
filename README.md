1. **Disenchantment of honour** → he strips it down to *air*, a “mere scutcheon,” a word that survives only as a sign, never as flesh. As you said, the honored isn’t alive to smell the roses; honour is praise for the dead, useful only to those who survive them.

2. **Reversal of counterfeit** → he takes the insult that dogs him (coward, counterfeit) and flips it.

   * To *die* is to counterfeit life.
   * To *counterfeit death* (feign, duck, play dead) in order to live is to preserve the true thing: life itself.
   * Therefore, “the better part of valour is discretion.”

Now, against your pentad, this speech resonates like this:

* **Physical (epλνq)**: Honour cannot “set to a leg.” It has no material persistence. Molecules endure longer than myths.
* **Biological (DNA → Phenotype)**: Honour cannot heal wounds, cannot restore phenotype to function. ATP, not “air,” repairs.
* **Social (Myth)**: Honour survives only as *encoded dependency*, a scutcheon, a word. Society feeds on symbols, not bodies.
* **Metaphysical (oaste)**: Honour is the cruelest *residual*. It accrues only to those selected out—those who do not survive.
* **Computational (θΣh(t)eθ’)**: Honour is *false convergence*—the update written into history’s code once the agent is gone, no longer iterating.

Falstaff’s radical move is ontological:

* **Honour persists only in myth**.
* **Life persists only in discretion**.

He isn’t counterfeiting; he’s exposing the counterfeit that society worships. *Dying for honour is dying for air.* Living through “counterfeit” (ducking, feigning) is the truest persistence of all.

🔥 So the catechism ends:

> “Honour is for the dead. Discretion is for the living. I’ll choose the living.”
